**PREWORK - FED**

Thanks for applying!

To make sure you're ready for this course, we're asking you to do a small "Pre-work" assignment. You must complete a small assignment to be accepted into our class. 

Before starting your assignment, finish step 1 and 2:

**STEP 1**: **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code), if you are using :**

\- macOS: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs?dv=osx

\- Windows: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=534107

Try to do your pre-work on VS Code.

**STEP 2**: **Set up your Github account **

 You need a github account to show us your pre-work by submitting your github link.

**CREATE A GITHUB ACCOUNT**

 Set up your free account by following these steps:

(If you already have a GitHub.com account, feel free to start your prework assignment in section below)

1. Access [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and click and enter a username, email address, and password in the supplied field and click **Sign up for GitHub**.
2. Select the **Unlimited public repositories for free **option.
3. You will receive a verification email at the address provided.
4. Click the emailed link to complete the verification process.

**INSTALL GIT **

To push your assignment to GitHub, you need to know how to use basic git command lines, no worries, we will show you.

**- Mac user:**

There are several ways to install Git on a Mac, the easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools, install Xcode from App Store may take you time, be patient!

You can do this simply by trying to run git from the Terminal the very first time.

``` 
$ git --version
```

If you don‚Äôt have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.

**- Window user:**

There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows. The most official build is available for download on the Git website. Just go to <http://git-scm.com/download/win> and the download will start automatically. 

Now You have Git installed, check Git version with

```
$ git ‚Äîversion
```

**Step 3:PRE-WORK ASSIGNMENT**

In your desktop, create a local folder ( from now we will call it local repo) name it as FED-prework, with 3 other repos inside, name them as assignment-1, assignment-2, assignment-3 and working on this repo FED-prework. After finishing your pre-work, you will push this repo on GitHub so we can see it.

**ASSIGNMENT 1 : Translating mockup to HTML**

- In this assignment, you‚Äôll be given a mock-up of a web page. Your task is to transform that mock-up into a real website using your HTML skills.


- You're going to see some formatting you haven't encountered before, so you'll need to use a resource, like the **MDN element reference**, to research new elements.

  ‚Äã

  **Assignment Instructions**


- Dowload and unzip the **mockup-to-article.zip**. In the zip file, you‚Äôll find the **index.html**, the article mockup image (**blog-mockup.pdf**). Use what you‚Äôve learned about web development so far to edit the index.html file so that it looks exactly like the mockup image. You will need to use new elements which means that you‚Äôll need to **research** and experiment! (Hint: look up "superscript," "horizontal rule," and "strikethrough."). Note: You can recreate the mockup without using a single <br> tag! You don't need to worry about line breaks. The text should naturally wrap depending on how wide the window is.


- When you've finished building the article, take a look at the reflection questions below. You've learned a lot about web development so far. Take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development.
  - What new skills have you learned?
  - What has been easy?
  - What has been difficult?

**ASSIGNMENT 2: Animal Trading Cards**

One common workflow for front-end web developers: you‚Äôll be provided with a design prototype that needs to be translated to an actual, functional website. In most cases, designers only provide you with the design prototype. However. For this project, I‚Äôve provided you with the design prototype and the HTML. The design prototype used in this project is inspired by trading cards and features a fish you might recognize from a popular animated film. You‚Äôll be creating the card and swapping out the fish with an animal of your choice.

**Assignment Instructions**

- Download and unzip **fend-animal-trading-cards.zip**. Inside, you‚Äôll find *card.html*, *styles.css*, *placeholder.png*, and the *design-prototype.png*.


- Next, open *card.html* and replace the placeholder image and information with your favorite pixels. If your image is larger, you can set the image‚Äôs *width* to 300 pixels in your CSS but be aware that your image might end up squished or distorted. Later, we‚Äôll talk about how you can fix this problem using **responsive images**. Also, don‚Äôt forget to change the image‚Äôs *alt* attribute to the name of your animal. So, *alt=‚Äùname-of-your-animal‚Äù* should be replaced with the actual name of your animal.


- Once you‚Äôve added your favorite animal‚Äôs image and information, add the proper CSS to *styles.css* to recreate the *design-prototype.png* by applying the style rules in step 3. You‚Äôll need to modify *card.html* to include attributes and use selectors


- The CSS should apply these styles to match the design prototype:


- italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
- bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
- no dots for the animal's list items
- border around the animal's name, image, and information
- border around the animal's information
- spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property **padding**)

Have fun and be creative üê† üêç üêÖ üêº üê´ ! Writing CSS isn't an exact science, so feel free to experiment. For example, you might want to add rounded corners or a background color to your card. Your submission should resemble the design prototype, but it's okay if it doesn't match exactly, so long as you satisfy all the requirements.

- When you've finished building the article, take a look at the reflection questions below. You've learned a lot about web development so far. Take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development.
  - What new skills have you learned?
  - What has been easy?
  - What has been difficult?

**ASSIGNMENT 3: Basic Google SearchMe page**

This assignment is optional but we hope you will try to make it, we are always available to help if you have any question. 

In this assignment, you will be provided with design prototype and HTML file, we are going to make a simple Google SearchMe page which allows us to search anything on the search bar and when we click the **SEARCH BUTTON** or press  **ENTER** , it will move to real Google Search page based on the keywork we have used to search. 

**Assignment Instructions**

1. Download and unzip **.zip**. Inside, you‚Äôll find *index.html*, *style.css*, , and the *searchme-design-prototype.png*.

2. You need to do things with 2 files: index.html and style.css

   **index.html : **

   At the moment, there is a search-area for us to type but when we click the button, it goes nowhere, you need to edit the **<form>** element so when we search for example: "coderschool", after clicking the button, it will go to Google page with results of ‚ÄúCoderschool‚Äù search keywork.

‚Äã	 (See the video below)

**Style.css file:**

 Add the proper CSS to recreate the prototype, you will need to modify the index.html to include attributes and use selectors.

1. - all the elements should horizontal centered. and it can be vertical centered or 500px from the top.

   - change the color of the word GOOGLE to make its colors similar to real Google logo, you can see its color here: <http://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/1872> (feel free to use any color you prefer, it is your playground, be creative as much as you can)

   - you may need to use the property "padding", "margin" to have space between the button and the search bar ‚Ä¶ please do some searching about it, and feel free to ask us if you can not find the information you need.

   - delete the underlines of the words: happy, energetic,‚Ä¶ they are supposed to be the clickable links 

     Now time to play! and don't forget we are here with you! 

     When you've finished, take a look at the reflection questions below. You've learned a lot about web development so far. Take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development.

   - - What new skills have you learned?
     - What has been easy?
     - What has been difficult?

**Step 4: PUSH YOUR PREWORK TO GITHUB**

Time to show us what you have worked hard on. We will show you how to push you pre-work on github so we can check, follow these steps:

1. Create a new repository (repo) on GitHub. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.

<create-repo-image>

2. Open Terminal.
3. Change the current working directory to your local project (FED-prework folder in Desktop). 

If you have not had experience with terminal yet, run this code

```
$ cd Desktop/ FED-prework
```

4. Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.

```
 $ git init
```

5. Add the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.

``` 
$ git add .
```

Note: There is a space between **add** and ‚Äú**.**‚Äù, it means add all the files in the repo FED-prework 

This step means: Adds the files in the local repository and stages them for commit. 

6. Commit the files that you've staged in your local repository.

``` 
$ git commit -m‚Äùfirst commit‚Äù
```

This step means:  Commits the tracked changes and prepares them to be pushed to a remote repository. 

7.  In GitHub page, At the top of your GitHub repository's Quick Setup page, click  to copy the remote repository URL.

<quick-setup-page-image>

8. In Terminal, add the URL for the remote repository, where your local repository (FED_prework) will be pushed.

``` 
$ git remote add origin remote repository URL
```

This step means: you are setting new remote

9. Push the change in your local repo to github

``` 
$ git push -u origin master
```

Now your repo FED-prework lives on GitHub and be ready for us to check.
